- **CUDA 12.4** (for GPU acceleration)  
  Install the [CUDA 12.4 Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) if you plan to use GPU acceleration.

### 2. **Installing eSpeak NG**

eSpeak NG is required for phoneme-based operations.

1. **Download the Installer**  
   [eSpeak NG X64 Installer](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases/download/1.51/espeak-ng-X64.msi)

2. **Run the Installer**  
   Follow the on-screen instructions.

3. **Set Environment Variables**  
   Add the following environment variables:

   - `PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_LIBRARY` → `C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG\libespeak-ng.dll`
   - `PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_PATH` → `C:\Program Files (x86)\eSpeak\command_line\espeak.exe`

   (Right-click "This PC" → Properties → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables)

4. **Verify Installation**

   Open Command Prompt and run:

   ```cmd
   espeak-ng --version
   ```

### 3. **Using Precompiled Wheels for DeepSpeed and lxml**

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the App**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select a Mode**
   - **Single Book:** Choose a PDF or EPUB file and extract its text.
   - **Batch Books:** Select a folder with multiple PDFs and/or EPUBs (processes all, preserving folder structure).
   - **Skip Extraction:** Use pre-extracted text files.

3. **Extract Text**
   - **PDFs:** Splits into chapters if TOC is available; otherwise, extracts entire document.
   - **EPUBs:** Extracts chapters based on internal structure.

4. **Configure Kokoro TTS Settings**
   - Select a voice.
   - Adjust chunk size and output format (`.wav` or `.mp3`).

5. **Generate Audiobook**
   - Click Start Process and monitor progress.
   - Find your audio files in the output folder.

## Testing Voices

With the latest update, you can now quickly test voices directly within the app:

1. **Navigate to the Voice Test Tab**  
   In the main window, click on the **Voice Test** tab to access voice testing features.

2. **Enter Sample Text**  
   Modify or use the default sample text in the provided text area.

3. **Select Test Mode**  
   - **Test Single Voice:** Pick one voice from the dropdown to generate a sample.
   - **Test All Available Voices:** Choose this option to automatically generate samples for every available voice.

4. **Run the Test**  
   Click **Run Voice Test** to start. The app creates a temporary file with your sample text, processes it through Kokoro TTS for each voice (if testing all voices), and saves the output audio files in the designated folder.

5. **Monitor Progress and Listen**  
   A progress bar and status labels keep you updated. Once the test is complete, you’ll be prompted to open the output folder where you can listen to the generated samples.

6. **Stop the Test if Needed**  
   If you need to cancel while testing, click **Stop Test** to interrupt the process.
